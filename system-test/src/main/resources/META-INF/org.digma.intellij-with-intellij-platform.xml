    <!--
       This file is meant to declare services and extension points that are common to all IDEs that
       are not Rider.
       these are services that are necessary only for language plugins that are implemented fully with intellij platform
       and run only on the JVM.
       the reason is it declares services and listeners that are not necessary in Rider.
       although they will load in Rider but usually do nothing.
       for example EditorEventsHandler will load in Rider but will ignore C# files.
