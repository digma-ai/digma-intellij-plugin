# Code Runtime Analysis for Non-Trivial Java  Code

<!-- https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax -->
<!-- Plugin description -->

Digma is an IDE plugin for [analyzing code runtime data](https://digma.ai/blog/introducing-the-digma-jetbrains-plugin/).
It enables rapid development in complex
projects by linting and detecting issues as they appear, highlighting possible risks in code and providing code change analysis and context

### Digma lints common code smells and issues as you code

- Error hotspots
- Bottlenecks and concurrency
- Query anti-patterns
  - Identify risks and affected code for code changes
- Performance trends

For more info check out the Digma [main repo](https://github.com/digma-ai/digma)

## Load to Idea

- load the project into IntelliJ IDEA community with 'Open' and select the project directory</br>
- setup jdk 11 for the project 'Project Structure'</br>
- setup ProjectJdk for gradle in 'Settings -> Gradle'</br>


### Local IDE testing with development instances

- in gradle.properties change 'platformType' to any of the supported IDEs, default is Rider</br>
- open gradle tool window in idea and execute task intellij.runIde. or from the 'Run/Debug configuration' load and run 'Run Plugin'</br>
- load a relevant project in the development instance</br>
- play with the plugin</br>

(when testing with IC or IU or RD it is possible to install the python plugin on the development instance 
and test python projects too)


### Rider

Rider implementation is in rider module. </br>
The dotnet solution can be opened with rider - rider/Digma.Rider.Plugin</br>
TBD: dotnet requirements
