upgrade your dotnet sdk to 8


load to idea:
close the digma-intellij-plugin project.
delete .idea folder
git reset --hard
git checkout support-2024.2-eap (or main after its merged)
delete folder buildSrc
its better to build from command line before loading first time, it will be faster. ./gradlew clean buildPlugin
load the project again by open -> project folder
let gradle finish building the model


Note: common-build-logic replaces buildSrc


remove setupDependencies:
in the plugin project, Open Gradle Tool Window
Right-click on the main module and select Tasks Activation
In the Tasks Activation modal window, find and remove the setupDependencies entry.



plugin description:
the plugin description is in a file PLUGIN-DESCRIPTION.md


before loading the dotnet project to Rider,
run a full build:
./gradlew clean buildPlugin [profile if you need]
or:
./gradlew :rider:prepare  [profile if you need]

and open the solution in rider/Digma.Rider.Plugin/Digma.Rider.Plugin.sln

Notes:
dropped support for intellij 2022.3
dropped support for python, not compiling the python module anymore.
