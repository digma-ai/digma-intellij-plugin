## Motivation
###########################################################
the motivation is to be able to build for different intellij releases without maintaining branches.

Note:
The build profiles require constant maintenance. when a new intellij patch is released we need to update
the corresponding profile so that we use the latest patch when building and testing.
EAP profile requires constant maintenance as new snapshots are released.
Rider and rd-gen require updating as new rd-gen versions are released.
etc.
this is a work that never ends.



## Build
############################################################

the project can build few profiles, each profile correspond to an intellij release, for example: p223, p231, p232

the profile names are the first 3 digits of intellij build number with a 'p' prefix. intellij build numbers
always start with 3 digits that correspond to the major release.
for example:
builds of release 2022.3 will start with 223.xxx.xxx, and also all patches like 2022.3.1,2022.3.2 etc.
builds of release 2023.2 will start with 232.xxx.xxx

the profile for EAP will be the same format, for example if the next EAP is 2023.3 the profile name will be p233.


## Adding Profiles
#############################################################
when a new intellij version start,usually with EAP builds, we should add a profile for the EAP. adding a profile
for EAP is a bit more difficult, not all products have the same build numbers and snapshots, and sometimes it takes time
to find all the relevant information. EAP requires constant maintenance every few days because new snapshots are released
almost every day.
the EAP profile is marked with isEAP = true.
when EAP is releases the profile needs to be updated to the release versions and marked isEAP = false.
Note that EAP build may fail often, so it needs constant care to make sure our github workflows don't fail.

to add a profile:
in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/common/BuildProfile.kt:
 add the new profile to the Profiles enum.
 add the profile to the profiles map.
in building-how-to/build-all-profiles.sh:
 add build lines for the new profile.
in .github/workflows
 fine all root workflows that have a matrix strategy with the list of profiles and add the new profile.
add new run configurations for the new profile.

## Removing old profiles
#############################################################
as new releases come out, older versions become more difficult to maintain because of API changes or build system changes,
sometimes new releases require changes in gradle build scripts that will not work with older versions.
we try to keep support for as many releases as possible without too much work. if it becomes too difficult to support
older releases we can remove the oldest profiles.
we must support at least 2 versions plus the next EAP.

to remove a profile do the revers of adding a profile.


## Profile aliases
############################################################
There are convenient aliases for building the lowest, latest or eap profiles.
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildProfile=lowest
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildProfile=latest
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildProfile=eap



## Run configurations
##############################################################
There is a run configuration for each profile that can be used to test the plugin with the different intellij release.
there are run configuration for all the products we support and every release we support.

There is a special run configuration for EAP that uses profile alias.



## Rider notes
##############################################################
rider uses the library rd-gen which should be different version for each IDE version.
see in settings.gradle.kts
need to map the profile name to a suitable rd-gen version and also support the correct profile alias lowest,latest,eap.



## How to use
##############################################################

profiles are declared in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/common/BuildProfile.kt
a profile holds a few properties for the project, mainly platformVersion,riderVersion and more.
data class BuildProfile(
    val profile: BuildProfiles.Profiles,
    val platformVersion: String,
    val riderVersion: String,
    val pycharmVersion: String,
    val riderResharperVersion: String,
    val riderResharperVersionConstant: String,
    val pythonPluginVersion: String,
    val platformVersionCode: String,
    val pluginSinceBuild: String,
    val pluginUntilBuild: String,
    val versionToRunPluginVerifier: String,
    val kotlinTarget: String,
    val javaVersion: String,
)


a profile is activated by a gradle property: buildProfile=[PROFILE]

for example:
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildProfile=p223
or
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildProfile=p232

when there is no profile the oldest release profile is active.


## How to build
############################################################

If you built the project with p223 profile, and now you want to build with p232 its necessary to clean before, mainly
because of some leftovers from previous build.
so a workflow could be something like:
you start a branch for some feature, do a clean build. form now on you work as usual. if you now want to
build and test with p231 or p232, do a clean build again.




## Intellij version codes:
############################################################

every intellij release has a 3 digits code that is used to identify the major version, its the first 3
digits of the intellij build number, for example for version 2023.2 and build 232.8453.116 the code is 232.

Intellij types:
IC=intellij community
IU=intellij ultimate
PC=pycharm community
PY=pycharm pro
RD=rider


## Build version:
############################################################

the plugin version is in version.properties and is the base plugin version, for example 2.0.90.
the final plugin zip will have a version that includes the intellij release code,
for example: 2.0.90+231, this is the version in plugin.xml.
this code is also used in sinceBuild=232 untilBuild=232.* in plugin.xml.

so 2.0.90+223 can be installed on 2022.3.*
and 2.0.90+231 can be installed on 2023.1.*
and 2.0.90+232 can be installed on 2023.2.*



## Build with specific IDE:
############################################################

besides the profiles, the build supports building with specific IDE.
usually a plugin can be built with the base platform , in our plugin, ide-common compiles
with the base platform. rider module compiles with rider, python compiles with idea+python plugin.

there are few gradle properties that when set will build the plugin with a specific IDE,
these are:
buildWithRider
buildWIthUltimate
buildWithPycharm
buildWithPycharmPro
if not supplied the default is IC

when supplied, then some modules will compile with the supplied IDE, ide-common and the main root module.
this can be used instead of running plugin verifier.

for example:
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildWIthUltimate=true -PbuildProfile=p232
or
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildWithRider=true -PbuildProfile=p232



## Loading in Idea:
############################################################

when buildProfile is activated it changes versions only for the build, your project in the IDE still compiles
with the oldest profile.
it's possible to load a different platform version in the IDE.
for example to load the latest version in Idea, add in gradle.properties

buildProfile=p232

that will load the profile dependencies to idea, doing that you can develop with another intellij version.



## Source base and compilation errors:
############################################################

in most cases its possible to build for different intellij versions with the same code base.
in C# code there is an easy solution with DefineConstants , a DefineConstants is injected to
Plugin.props file during build, the constant is per profile and declared in the build profile.

for example:

#if (PROFILE_2022_3)
    public CodeLensAnchorKind DefaultAnchor => CodeLensAnchorKind.Top;
    public ICollection<CodeLensRelativeOrdering> RelativeOrderings => new CodeLensRelativeOrdering[]
        { new CodeLensRelativeOrderingFirst() };
#else
    public CodeVisionAnchorKind DefaultAnchor => CodeVisionAnchorKind.Top;
    public ICollection<CodeVisionRelativeOrdering> RelativeOrderings => new CodeVisionRelativeOrdering[]
        { new CodeVisionRelativeOrderingFirst() };


or
#if (PROFILE_2023_2)
using JetBrains.ReSharper.Feature.Services.Protocol;
#else
using JetBrains.RdBackend.Common.Features;
#endif


in kotlin/java it is probably possible to do things with reflection for different intellij versions.
or use different source base, or additional source bases.
currently there was no need, but solutions are there.



## Run IDE:
############################################################

there are launchers to run the various IDEs with different version,
and it's also possible to launch an IDE from command line:
see build-all.sh for examples.

for example:
./gradlew clean buildPlugin runIde -PbuildWithRider=true -PbuildProfile=p232
./gradlew clean buildPlugin -PbuildWithPycharm=true -PbuildProfile=p232

if you run for example idea latest and now want to run rider eap a clean is necessary.


## github actions
############################################################

There are github actions that run on push to main and build main branch for different IDE releases.
to download and install for specific IDE find the corresponding workflow and download the zip from there.

the publish workflow runs 3 times when releasing and publishes 3 versions to marketplace.
for example:
2.0.93+223
2.0.93+231
2.0.93+232
